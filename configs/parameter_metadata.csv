"Essentials",open_simplified_rep_by_default,"You should be using this all the time."
"Essentials",spin_with_3d_datum_planes,"If you have a good graphics card, turn it on to spin with 3D datum planes."
"Recommended",sketcher_disp_weak_dimensions,"Turning this off (no) hides automatically generated weak dimensions in Sketcher, decluttering the sketch and allowing you to focus on critical dimensions."
"Recommended",sketcher_refit_after_dim_modify,"Disabling this (set to no) prevents the sketch view from automatically refitting (zooming out) after each dimension change, so your view remains focused where you are working."
"Recommended",spin_center_display,"Turning off the on-screen spin center indicator makes the display less cluttered while rotating the model (the spin center can still be toggled or used as needed)."
"Recommended",tangent_edge_display,"Setting this to 'dimmed' displays tangent edges in a subdued gray rather than solid lines. This improves visual clarity by showing tangencies softly without overwhelming the model view."
"Recommended",edge_display_quality,"Using a high setting provides smoother, less faceted curved edges in the model display at the cost of some performance. This improves the visual quality of curves and circles in shaded view."
"Recommended",enable_fsaa,"Enables full-scene anti-aliasing (e.g., 4x) to smooth jagged edges on screen. This makes edges and details appear smoother for better visual quality, though higher settings may slightly impact graphics performance."
"Recommended",measure_auto_replace_mode,"When enabled (yes), the measure tool automatically replaces the second reference on new selections, allowing quicker successive measurements without manually clicking 'Replace' each time."
"Recommended",measure_dialog_expand,"Setting this to yes makes the Measure dialog open fully expanded by default, so all measurement results and options are immediately visible, improving efficiency by removing extra clicks."
"Recommended",open_window_maximized,"Opens Creo Parametric in a maximized window by default, which is especially helpful on smaller screens to use the full screen space without having to maximize the window manually."
"Recommended",enable_advance_collision,"Enables advanced collision detection in assembly or mechanism mode (e.g., a 'Stop when colliding' option during component drag), which helps in identifying interference by halting movement on contact."
"Performance",open_simplified_rep_by_default,"When set to yes, Creo will prompt to open a Simplified Representation by default. This is useful for large assemblies, as you can load a lighter rep for faster loading and then retrieve details as needed."
"Performance",blended_transparency,"Turning this off (no) disables alpha blending for transparent objects. This can improve performance in scenes with many transparent components (at the expense of visual realism) by simplifying how transparency is rendered."
"Performance",mass_property_calculate,"For large assemblies or on-demand analysis, setting this to by_request (instead of automatic) will calculate mass properties only when prompted, improving regeneration speed. Conversely, using automatic ensures up-to-date mass properties at each regeneration (helpful when weight tracking is critical)"
